# Understanding Natural Language Processing with Me!

Hi, I‚Äôm Shiyi. Welcome to my technical blog. Please check out this [page](https://shiyis.github.io/nlp-docs) for a more detailed account of my journey with respect to learning Natural Language Processing. Here I will only be documenting the gists. I will be presenting everything I have learned so far, including important concepts, necessary code snippets, and more. I am by no means an expert in this subject, but I have gone through extensive studies and training in the fields and subfields related to have a good grasp of what‚Äôs important.

Areas that I have dabbled in,

```

‚Üí General Linguistics
‚Üí Symbolic Computational Linguistics
‚Üí Statistical Natural Language Processing
‚Üí State of the Art Large Language Modeling

```

### **The Subject Matter**

What do we mean by Natural Language Processing? If we do a little googling and researching, it's very intuitive that natural language processing involves a set of solutions to various natural human language tasks. The most common ones are

```plaintext

‚Üí Sentiment analysis
‚Üí Machine translation
‚Üí Word-sense disambiguation
‚Üí Named-entity recognition
‚Üí Topic modeling
‚Üí Text classification
‚Üí Document Classification
‚Üí Question answering

```

### **A Little Bit Of History**

The history of Computational Linguistics dates back to the 40s to 50s. So, it's not very long ago that the field that has created ChatGPT or any form of AI that is so commonly adopted in every aspect of our lives now started to have its very first ancestral ideation. It's still a fairly new and young field with infinite possibilities up for exploration.

Before diving in, first we have to ask ourselves what exactly is artificial intelligence (AI)?

According to the official definition extracted out of John McCarthy's 2004 [paper](https://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai.pdf) listed on IBM's [website](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence),

```plaintext
ü§ñÔ∏è "It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines,
 especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar
 task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does
 not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."
```

So if it's to understand human intelligence, we need to know how we as humans gain information and human intelligence, or the brain, really works both through physiology and psychology,

```plaintext
  üí° Two Important Sources of Knowledge: Rationalism and Empiricism.

  The first acquires knowledge through reasoning and logic, while the second
  through experience and experimentation.
```

Below are some important notes with respect to the **historical timeline** of the development of Computational Linguistics and NLP and how it all started from one of these two principles and gradually transitioned to the other (rationalism / computationalism to empiricism / connectionism; although computationalism is not always symbolic; namely it also incorporates empirical evidence):
