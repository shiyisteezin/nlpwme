## Making Dynamic Decisions with Sequence to Sequence Language Processing Tasks

\toc


We will examine a comprehensive, intricate example of a Bi-LSTM Conditional Random Field for named-entity recognition in this section.

For part-of-speech tagging, the LSTM tagger mentioned above is usually adequate; but, for good performance on NER, a sequence model such as the CRF is truly necessary.

Knowledge of CRFs is presumed. Despite the ominous moniker, this model is really a CRF with features provided by an LSTM.

However, compared to the previous models in this tutorial, this one is far more complex and intricate. It's okay if you choose not to participate. Try the following to see whether you're ready:

- At step $I$ for tag $K$, write the recurrence for the viterbi variable.

- To compute the forward variables, alter the recurrence above.

- To calculate the forward variables in log-space, modify the aforementioned recurrence one more (hint: log-sum-exp).

The code below should make sense to you if you can accomplish those three tasks. Remember that a conditional probability is computed by the CRF. Let x be the word input sequence and y be the tag sequence. 

The graphic is composed of mathematical formulas and explanations pertaining to a Bi-LSTM neural network and Conditional Random Field (CRF) model used for sequence tagging tasks. The LaTeX formulae are as follows:

1. The conditional probability of a tag sequence $y$ given an input sequence $x$ is computed as:
$$ P(y|x) = \frac{\exp(\text{Score}(x, y))}{\sum_{y'} \exp(\text{Score}(x, y'))} $$

2. The score of a sequence is the sum of log potentials $\psi_i(x, y)$:
$$ \text{Score}(x, y) = \sum_{i} \log \psi_i(x, y) $$

3. The score is further detailed for a Bi-LSTM CRF model, considering emission and transition potentials:
$$ \text{Score}(x, y) = \sum_{i} \log \psi_{\text{EMIT}}(y_i \rightarrow x_i) + \log \psi_{\text{TRANS}}(y_{i-1} \rightarrow y_i) $$

4. The score is then expressed in terms of the hidden state $h_i$ of the Bi-LSTM and the transition scores $P_{y_i,y_{i-1}}$:

$$= \sum_{i} h_i[y_i] + P_{y_i,y_{i-1}}$$

Additionally, the text states that in order to make the partition function tractable, the potentials must only consider local features. The transition scores are kept in a matrix $P$, where the score of transitioning from tag $k$ to tag $j$ is represented by the symbol $P_{j,k}$.

The following example uses the viterbi algorithm for decoding and the forward method in log space to calculate the partition function. The gradients will be computed automatically for us via backpropagation. Nothing needs to be done by hand.

There is inefficiency in the implementation. If you comprehend what's happening, you'll undoubtedly notice quite soon that the forward algorithm's iteration over the next tag may potentially be completed in a single large operation.

```python

import torch
import torch.autograd as autograd
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

torch.manual_seed(1)

```


```python

def argmax(vec):
    # return the argmax as a python int
    _, idx = torch.max(vec, 1)
    return idx.item()


def prepare_sequence(seq, to_ix):
    idxs = [to_ix[w] for w in seq]
    return torch.tensor(idxs, dtype=torch.long)


# Compute log sum exp in a numerically stable way for the forward algorithm
def log_sum_exp(vec):
    max_score = vec[0, argmax(vec)]
    max_score_broadcast = max_score.view(1, -1).expand(1, vec.size()[1])
    return max_score + \
        torch.log(torch.sum(torch.exp(vec - max_score_broadcast)))

```
