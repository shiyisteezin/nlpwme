## RoBERTa or A Robustly Optimized BERT Approach
Let's start with the basic components and concepts of RoBERTa:

### 1. Self-Attention Mechanism:
The self-attention mechanism in RoBERTa allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when encoding them into contextual embeddings. It computes attention scores between all pairs of words in a sentence.

### 2. Pre-training Objectives:
RoBERTa is pre-trained using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective. In MLM, some tokens in the input sequence are randomly masked, and the model is trained to predict these masked tokens based on the context provided by the other tokens in the sequence.

### 3. Transformer Architecture:
RoBERTa is built upon the transformer architecture, consisting of stacked self-attention layers and feed-forward neural networks.

### Formula for Masked Language Modeling Objective:
Given an input sequence $ X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) $, where $ x_i $ represents the i-th token, the objective is to predict the masked tokens $ X_{\text{masked}} = (x_{m1}, x_{m2}, ..., x_{mk}) $, where $ m $ represents the indices of masked tokens.

The probability of predicting each masked token $ x_{mi} $ is calculated using softmax over the vocabulary:
$$ P(x_{mi} | X_{\text{context}}) = \text{softmax}(Wx_{mi} + b) $$

Where:
- $ W $ is the weight matrix of the final layer of the transformer.
- $ b $ is the bias vector.
- $ X_{\text{context}} $ represents the context tokens in the input sequence, excluding the masked token.

### Simple Coding Example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Define the RoBERTa-like model
class RoBERTa(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_size, hidden_size):
        super(RoBERTa, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_size)
        self.transformer_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(
                            d_model=embedding_size, nhead=8, dim_feedforward=hidden_size)
        self.transformer = nn.TransformerEncoder(
                            self.transformer_layer, num_layers=6)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(embedding_size, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, input_ids):
        embedded = self.embedding(input_ids)
        encoded = self.transformer(embedded)
        logits = self.fc(encoded)
        return logits

# Example usage
vocab_size = 10000  # Example vocabulary size
max_seq_length = 128  # Example maximum sequence length
model = RoBERTa(vocab_size, embedding_size=256, hidden_size=1024)

# Example input tensor (batch_size, sequence_length)
input_ids = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (32, max_seq_length))

# Forward pass
logits = model(input_ids)

# Calculate probabilities using softmax
probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
```

This example demonstrates a simple implementation of a RoBERTa-like model in PyTorch, including the masked language modeling objective and inference. In practice, the model architecture and training process would be more complex, but this provides a basic illustration of the concepts involved.
